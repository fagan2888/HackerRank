# 30 Days of Code

This folder consists of the solutions that I submitted for the 30 Days of Code Challenge which you can find [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code).

The problem statements are not given in this folder and you will have to visit HackerRank itself for the problem statements.

Although it reads 30 days of code, I don't think it should take you more than a day to go through the problems.

*Fairly simple*, **but** *that's just my opinion.*
